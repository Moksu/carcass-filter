carcass.filter
A loot filter for Path of Exile.

This filter is heavily inspired by NeverSink and some sections are borrowed from it, but it is stricter and more minimalistic than even NeverSink's Uber-Strict
For leveling and mapping early on in a league I recommend using NeverSink's Regular filter instead:
